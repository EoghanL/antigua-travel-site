    <h3>A chicken bus is a colloquial English name for a colorful, modified and decorated bus that transports goods and people between communities in various Latin American countries, especially Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama.<br>
      The base vehicle is usually a retired North American school bus on a light or medium truck chassis. The word "chicken" may refer to the fact that the buses are often crammed with passengers not unlike a truck load of chickens, or to
      the fact that Central Americans occasionally transport live animals on such busesâ€“a practice that visitors from other countries often find remarkable<br></h3>
